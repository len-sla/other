It is a very popular model for these type of tasks and the algorithm behind it is quite easy to understand and use. Also, the Scikit-Learn library has a very good implementation for the algorithm,\n","\n","\n","Topic Modelling is an unsupervised Machine Learning task where we try to discover \"abstract topics\" that can describe a collection of documents. This means we have a collection of texts and we try to find patterns of words and phrases that can help us cluster the documents and group them by \"topics\".\n","\n","I put topics into quotes and I call them abstract topics because these are not obvious topics and we don't need them to be. We work on the assumption that similar documents will have similar patterns of words and phrases\n","\n","For example, let's say we have a collection of 100 texts. We go through each text and discover that ten of them contain words like \"machine learning\", \"training\", \"supervised\", \"unsupervised\", \"dataset\" and so on. We may not know what these words mean and we really don't care.\n","\n","We only see a pattern here, that 10% of our articles contain these words and we conclude that they should be included in the same topic. We can't actually name the topic and again, this is not needed. We are able to cluster these 10 articles into the same topic. And when we get a new text which we have never seen before, we look into it, we find it contains some of these words, then we'll be able to say \"hey, this goes into the same category with the other 10 articles!\"\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm works with a few simple steps. The only preprocessing we need to do is the one we do in almost all text processing tasks: removing the stopwords(words that, with a high probability, are found in most of the documents and don't bring any value)  from all of our documents.\n","\n","  * Establish a number of n topics that will be identified by the LDA algorithm. How can we find the perfect number of topics? Well, it's not very easy and it's usually a trial and error process: we try different values for n until we are satisfied with the results. Or, maybe we are lucky and we have other information about the dataset that allows us to establish the perfect number of topics.\n","  * Assign every word in every document to a temporary topic.
